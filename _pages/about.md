 I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Gamze Gürsoy](http://g2lab.org)'s lab, where I have been working since March 2022. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematical Science at Seoul National University, South Korea, advised by [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/). 
 
 My primary research focuses on practical applications of cryptosystems, especially in homomorphic encryption, privacy-preserving machine learning, and genomic data privacy. I work extensively with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), optimizing FHE schemes algorithmically and developing algorithms to enable non-arithmetic operations within FHE. In privacy-preserving machine learning, I adapt machine learning algorithms to FHE-compatible formats, utilizing polynomial approximation techniques to achieve secure and efficient computation. My research in genomic data privacy emphasizes designing FHE-based frameworks that enable secure transformations of conventional genomic applications, protecting sensitive genomic information. I am also dedicated to advancing functional encryption by creating schemes that offer enhanced efficiency and functionality.
