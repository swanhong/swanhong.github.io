I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
My major research topics are homomorphic encryption and its applications, including algorithms for homomorphic non-arithmetic operations and privacy-preserving machine learning. Additionaly, I am broadly interested in all aspects of cryptography and mathematical problems derived from them. 

I received my Bachelor's degree with Highest Honors from Mathematical Sciences at SNU in 2016.
